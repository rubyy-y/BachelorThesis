# This file will be needed to transform the json files;
# the compiles vega does not offer the needed specs to implement in the file
# example: container heigt
    # original json says "config": {"view": {"continuousHeight": 300, "continuousWidth": 400}}
    # but we need "height": "container"
    #             "width": "container"
# also "background": null

# This file will also combine two comparisions
# and remove the click actions button
