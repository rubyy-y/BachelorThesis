7 properties:

config:
Vega-Lite configuration object. This property can only be defined at the top-level of a specification.


data:
Required. An object describing the data source. Set to null to ignore the parentâ€™s data source. If no data is set, it is derived from the parent.


mark:
Required. A string describing the mark type (one of "bar", "circle", "square", "tick", "line", "area", "point", "rule", "geoshape", and "text") or a mark definition object.


encoding:
A key-value mapping between encoding channels and definition of fields.


selection:


$schema:
URL to JSON schema for a Vega-Lite specification. Unless you have a reason to change this, use https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json. Setting the $schema property allows automatic validation and autocomplete in editors that support JSON schema.


datasets:
Vega-Lite supports a top-level datasets property. This can be useful when the same data should be inlined in different places in the spec. Instead of setting values inline, specify datasets at the top level and then refer to the named datasource in the rest of the spec. datasets is a mapping from name to an inline dataset.
